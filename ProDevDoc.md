## Qualitative Features

1. I have and, am proud of, my strong work ethic.
2. I'm very intuitive and pick up on things quick.
3. Able to handle extreme stress\Calm under pressure.

## How I Develop my Brain

I constantly read "tech savvy" articles to expand my knowledge of the industry.
I do brain teaser puzzles on my freetime sometimes to keep my brain sharp.
I try to always formally introduce myself when i meet new people to improve those skills.

## Golden Circle

Why - love building/creating things things(don't really care what).

How - Coding skills.

What - Building programs/apps.

## Initiatives

### Direct

- Go to tech industry meet-ups and "shake hands"/introduce myself to potential employers.

- Approach smaller business about potentially building something for them.

- Email recruiters directly about potential job openings.

### Indirect

- Advertise my skills/ offer to do a job on a social media platform.

- Accept a freelance job for free to gain organic referrals.

- Join a paid referrals firm.

## Worth Questions

1. I have lacked confidence and motivation in the past to take advantages
of opportunities in the past, something I definitely still need to work on.
2. For past employers I have created value by being a hard-working, dependable
employee. In my personal life, I don't.
3. Yes, I believe I am capable of just about anything if I could be more confident
about things, but I also know I lack confidence and I'll never be able to do much
until I can fix that.

## Elevator Pitch

### Version 1
Hey there, my name is Jake. I love building any kind of app or program
because I simply love to build new things. I usually use coding languages like Java or HTML to make them.
Do you have anything you might want built?

# Reflections

I was unable to find myself through google, which makes me realise I need to
increase my online presences. Perhaps I will try to be more active on my social 
media accounts and add more detail to them. Hopefully with time i can gro my linkedin 
profile so it pops up when my name is googled.

Week 5 - After the end of week 5 I'm feeling pretty confident with my understanding of
the material in the course. I've started working on a rough prototype of the capstone project
that has been a little rough, but I'm learning alot from it. I don't know what else you want from me in these :).
