Hey there, my name is Jake. I love building any kind of app or program
because I simply love to build new things. I usually use coding languages like Java or HTML to make them.
Do you have anything you might want built?

# Reflections

I was unable to find myself through google, which makes me realise I need to
increase my online presences. Perhaps I will try to be more active on my social 
media accounts and add more detail to them. Hopefully with time i can gro my linkedin 
profile so it pops up when my name is googled.
